Approach: commenting of proportionality from EBA guideline to ECB supervision

problem: too high compliance cost for small and non-complex FI
Part 1: overview of analysis cost of compliance (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2021/1013948/Study%20of%20the%20cost%20of%20compliance%20with%20supervisory%20reporting%20requirement.pdf)
- technical standard is one of the main driver of cost of compliance -> in 2021, EBA amended 1 ITS regarding to the COREP, asset encumbrance, ALMM and G-SII reporting (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Draft%20Technical%20Standards/2021/ITS%20on%20OF%20GSII%20ALMM/1025603/Final%20Report%20on%20draft%20ITS%20on%20Supervisory%20Reporting%20regarding%20COREP%2C%20AE%2C%20ALMM%20and%20GSIIs.pdf)
  -> to reduce compliance cost                                                                                                                                                                      
" The report on the cost of compliance study put forward the proposal for specific simplifications 
for SNCIs and medium institutions in the areas of asset encumbrance and ALMM reporting. The 
amending implementing technical standards included in this report aim to put these 
simplifications into effect by the end of 2022. Following the recommendations of the cost of 
compliance study, the scope of reporting on ALMM by SNCIs will be reduced by half the number 
of templates, while medium institutions benefit from the exemption from reporting one 
template. In the area of asset encumbrance reporting, SNCIs will, by default, only report a core 
set of data points and will be exempted from reporting supplementary details."

Part 2: EBA effort to improve proportionality but the discussion is now closed (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-launches-discussion-proportionality-assessment)

Part 3: simplified obligations for recovery and resolution planning already stated in BRRD. current used of simplified obligation in BRRD (ref:  https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2020/961800/EBA%20Report%20on%20Simplified%20Obligations%20and%20Waivers%20under%20BRRD.pdf)
-> Dung phan nay cho sanction chang?

Part 4: IRRBB reporting (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Consultations/2023/Consultation%20on%20the%20ITS%20on%20Supervisory%20Reporting%20with%20regard%20to%20IRRBB%20reporting/1051371/Consultation%20Paper%20on%20the%20ITS%20on%20Supervisory%20Reporting%20regarding%20IRRBB.pdf)

Part 5: Proportionality in supervisory practice (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2023/1055271/Report%20on%20convergence%20of%20supervisory%20practices%20in%202022.pdf)
-> only having proportionaility in AML/CFT
-> not good proportionality in ICT

Part 6: EU-wide Stress test (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/EU-wide%20Stress%20Testing/2023/1037330/2023%20EU-wide%20stress%20test%20-%20Draft%20Methodological%20Note.pdf)
Annex IX: Additional proportionality elements for smaller banks
In line with paragraph 9, banks may be allowed to apply additional proportionality 
elements, when interpreting the methodology. Additional proportionality elements of the 2023
EU-wide stress test will be facilitated, in particular, by an extensive use of materiality thresholds. 
For starting point data and bottom-up projections banks are allowed to apply the following 
materiality thresholds and simplifications as compared with the general methodology.:
