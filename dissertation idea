Approach: commenting of proportionality from EBA guideline to ECB supervision

problem: too high compliance cost for small and non-complex FI, EBA provide road map for more intergraton of principle of proportionality into it guideline (https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf)

- technical standard is one of the main driver of cost of compliance -> in 2021, EBA amended 1 ITS regarding to the COREP, asset encumbrance, ALMM and G-SII reporting (ref: https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Draft%20Technical%20Standards/2021/ITS%20on%20OF%20GSII%20ALMM/1025603/Final%20Report%20on%20draft%20ITS%20on%20Supervisory%20Reporting%20regarding%20COREP%2C%20AE%2C%20ALMM%20and%20GSIIs.pdf)

" The report on the cost of compliance study put forward the proposal for specific simplifications 
for SNCIs and medium institutions in the areas of asset encumbrance and ALMM reporting. The 
amending implementing technical standards included in this report aim to put these 
simplifications into effect by the end of 2022. Following the recommendations of the cost of 
compliance study, the scope of reporting on ALMM by SNCIs will be reduced by half the number 
of templates, while medium institutions benefit from the exemption from reporting one 
template. In the area of asset encumbrance reporting, SNCIs will, by default, only report a core 
set of data points and will be exempted from reporting supplementary details."

Annex IX: Additional proportionality elements for smaller banks
In line with paragraph 9, banks may be allowed to apply additional proportionality 
elements, when interpreting the methodology. Additional proportionality elements of the 2023
EU-wide stress test will be facilitated, in particular, by an extensive use of materiality thresholds. 
For starting point data and bottom-up projections banks are allowed to apply the following 
materiality thresholds and simplifications as compared with the general methodology.:

Part 13: CREDIT RISK
- Counter cyclical buffer: The CRD IV package has introduced a countercyclical buffer (CCB) For the purposes of proportionality, a materiality threshold of 2% relative 
to the overall credit risk exposure is proposed, so that institutions with capital requirements for specific 
risk and IRC below this threshold can use a simpler approach to identify the various geographical
locations of their trading book exposures. If an institution has only minor cross-border activities, the size of these foreign exposures should 
arguably have a limited impact on the institution-specific buffer rate calculation. Therefore, as a 
simplifying assumption, for the purpose of identifying their geographical location, foreign exposures 
below a pre-specified threshold, also proposed at 2% of the overall credit risk exposure, could be 
allocated to the country in which the institution is registered.
