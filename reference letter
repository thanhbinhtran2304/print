Sure, here’s a reference letter tailored for Dieu Linh Lương’s application for the Technology & Data Regulatory Relations Analyst position:

Dear HR of AIB,

I am Binh Tran from the Model Validation Team, Risk Analytics, and I am writing to recommend Dieu Linh Lương for the Technology & Data Regulatory Relations Analyst position at AIB.

I have known Linh for over five years since we studied together at Foreign Trade University (FTU) in Vietnam and participated in FTU’s Student Union. Her exceptional analytical and technological skills were evident from the start, prompting me to encourage her to pursue a Master of Laws and Finance at Trinity College Dublin. During our time together, I have observed Linh’s remarkable achievements and research endeavors, which have demonstrated her strong analytical capabilities, technical proficiency, and keen interest in the regulatory landscape.

Linh has consistently displayed an aptitude for understanding complex regulatory frameworks and data analysis. She won Second Prize at the Vietnam Moot Competition, which qualified her for the International Moot Competition in Germany, where she showcased her deep understanding of international regulations and data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, she published a paper in the Journal of Legislative Studies of Vietnam Parliament in her third year at university, highlighting her ability to conduct thorough and impactful research.

Beyond her academic achievements, Linh has shown initiative and dedication in her professional endeavors. During her internship at the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), she conducted insightful research on legislative drafts, demonstrating her ability to analyze and interpret regulatory data effectively. Additionally, her completion of the lawyer training program in Vietnam further underscores her commitment to understanding and applying regulatory requirements.

Linh’s current academic performance in the Master of Laws and Finance program at Trinity College Dublin continues to be outstanding. Her ability to integrate legal and financial principles with technology and data analysis makes her a strong candidate for the Technology & Data Regulatory Relations Analyst position. Her innovative approach and analytical rigor would be valuable assets to your team.

I highly recommend Dieu Linh for this position. She is a highly motivated, results-oriented individual with a strong work ethic, a quick learner, and a collaborative team player. Her academic background, research contributions, and practical experience make her an exceptional candidate for your technology and data regulatory team.

Please feel free to contact me if you require further information or have any questions.

Binh Tran
