Dear HR of AIB,

I’m Binh Tran from model validation team, Risk Analytics, I am writing to you today to recommend Dieu Linh Luong for a legal position in the AIB’s graduation program. I have known Linh for more than 5 years since we start studying together in Foreign Trade University (FTU) in Vietnam as well as both participating in FTU’s Student Union. Her exceptional abilities in legal were so impressive that I encouraged her to pursue a Master of Laws and Finance at Trinity College Dublin.

I have had the privilege of closely observing Dieu Linh's remarkable achievements and research endeavors, which have showcased her exceptional legal aptitude, analytical skills, and passion for the legal field. She has won Second Prize for Vietnam Moot Competition that qualify her to International Moot Competition that take place in Germany where she demonstrates her deep understanding of international investment law and her proficiency in conducting independent research. She also has 1 publication in Journal of Legislative Studies of Vietnam Parliament in her third year in university which made her very outstanding compared to her peers in FTU. 

Beyond her academic achievements, Dieu Linh has also demonstrated remarkable initiative when making commentative research on legislation drafts during her internship at the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI). I also known that she has finished with lawyer training program in Vietnam. 
I am confident that Dieu Linh would bring a fresh perspective and analytical rigor for legal because for now she is still very outstanding in her master class of Law and Finance 2023-2024 in Trinity College Dublin where I just graduated and acknowledged the competency of classmate.  
I highly recommend Dieu Linh for a position in gradation program. She is a highly motivated, results-oriented individual with a strong work ethic, a quick learner, and a team player. Her academic achievements, research contributions, and work experience make her an exceptional candidate for your legal team.
Please feel free to contact me if you require further information or have any questions.
Best Regards,
