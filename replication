The replication work by MVT followed these steps:

Executing the SQL/SAS codes provided by MDT to extract relevant data from the FDM, including creating the modeling dataset and RDS.
Running the SAS codes.
Replicating key input and output tables.
Matching key outputs identified in step 3 with those in the model development documentation.
Steps 1 and 2 - Executing Data Extraction and Model SAS Codes:
The data for the Bank model comes from the Tier 2 data infrastructure, particularly the Capital Markets database. MVT replicated this data extraction using MDT-provided SAS codes. While the codes generally ran without major issues, MVT had to coordinate with MDT to resolve minor errors and ensure a 100% match rate. Issues were quickly resolved as the development team provided necessary updates or additional codes.

Step 3 â€“ Identifying Key Input and Output Tables:
Outputs were sometimes compared outside of SAS by exporting datasets or pasting SAS results into Excel. The SAS Proc Compare function was also used in some cases.

Step 4 - Matching Key Outputs to Model Development Documentation:
MVT compared its generated outputs with those in the model development documentation for the key output tables/graphs identified in Step 3. When outputs were pasted into Excel and calculated, MVT ensured the SAS inputs into Excel matched the generated SAS tables. All major model components were successfully replicated without significant findings, only minor advisory issues that did not impact the results.

Replication Results: Summary:
The table below summarizes the replication work performed for data extraction, RDS, and development datasets.

MVT reviewed all the codes received from the development team and checked it against the model documentation to ensure formulae and model methodology described in the development documentation were coded as described. 
This section outlines key validation activities conducted by MVT for the computer code review. In particular are reported all activities performed to review the code produced to generate:
