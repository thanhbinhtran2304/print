The replication work performed by MVT has been conducted in the following order:
1. Running the SQL/SAS codes provided by MDT which extract the relevant data from the FDM and includes the creation of the modelling dataset and the RDS.
2. Running the SAS codes.
3. Replication of key input and output tables.
4. Matching key outputs identified in step 3 and of the key output tables/graphs produced to those in the model development documentation.

Steps 1 and 2 - Running the data extraction and model SAS codes 
Data used in the Bank model is sourced from the Tier 2 data infrastructure, in particular the Capital Markets database.
MVT replicated the data extraction for the Bank model.  This data extraction was performed using codes provided by the MDT whereby the MVT ran the SAS codes.  
The codes generally did not contain any major errors, although the MVT had to liaise with the MDT regarding the output datasets generated by the code, or troubleshooting smaller parts of incorrect code to ensure the match rate was 100%. The issues were resolved with minimal impact and turnaround time as the development team provided the necessary updates, additional codes, or dropped the additional tables to ensure the codes ran correctly.  

Step 3 â€“ Identifying the key input and output tables  
In some cases, outputs were compared outside of SAS by exporting datasets from SAS or pasting SAS results into an Excel file. In other instances, the SAS Proc Compare function was used.

Step 4 - Matching key outputs to those in the model development document 
For the key output tables/graphs identified in Step 3 above, MVT compared its generated outputs with those in the model development documentation.  In some cases, final outputs were pasted into Excel and then subsequently calculated.  For these outputs, MVT checked that the SAS inputs into Excel were the same as the generated SAS tables. 
All major components of the model have been successfully replicated with no findings identified. Only minor advisory issues, which do not impact the model results.
