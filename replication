The data evaluation process involved the Risk Data Team (RDT) conducting data attestation. Standard controls and ad-hoc checks, designed by MVT, were applied to assess the internal Bank RDS. This ensured data suitability for modeling and confirmed its lineage to the source. The RDT's attestation encompassed:

Completeness: Verifying presence of required attribute values.
Accuracy: Ensuring data is largely error-free.
Consistency: Matching data across different institutional sources.
Validity: Confirming data classification is rigorous and acceptable.
Uniqueness: Ensuring aggregate data lacks duplications.
Timeliness: Verifying data currency.
Traceability: Ensuring easy tracking of data history, processing, and location.
Logs detailing the attestation of RDS fields were compiled, aiming to primarily source data from FDM within EDW. Alternate data tables were also identified and recommended where FDM data equivalents were unavailable. Results from these tests determined inclusion of fields in model development. The attestation log and a Masterfile listing tests with unique identifiers, descriptions, and logic used were submitted, alongside separate files detailing test results.

MVT reviewed RDT's attestation process, conducting sense checks on the tests (excluding traceability) for selected fields. MVT additionally assessed traceability by verifying documentation existence as provided by RDT.
